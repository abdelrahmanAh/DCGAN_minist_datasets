# DCGAN_minist_datasets
DCGANs using minist datasets
<h2>DCGANs model using MNIST datasets </h2><br>
this model just generate data doesnot exist in real world <br>
the data we have trained digits number<br>
the model is free from CNNs and it make result <br>
<h3>before training model and it 's  generated images like</h3> <br>
<img src='first.png'>
<h3>in training model and it is generated images like </h3><br>
<img src='between.png'><br>
<h3>after training model and it 's  generated images like</h3> <br>
<img src='last.png'><br>
notes : <br>
also there is a tensorboard to see the training <br>
to see it just write this command in the same folder<br>
tensorboard --logdir=logs
